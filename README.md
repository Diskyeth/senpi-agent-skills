## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Get Started

First, fork the repository and then clone it locally to your machine.

Once you cloned the repository, you can setup your environment with the following scripts:

```bash
cd moxie-agent-skills
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && cd ./packages/moxie-agent-lib && pnpm run build && cd ../../ && pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Once the agent is running, you should see the message to run "pnpm start:client" at the end.
Open another terminal and move to same directory and then run below command and follow the URL to chat to your agent.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Once you're all setup, you can start developing your Moxie Creator Agent Skills.

### Create Your First Skills

You can start creating your first Moxie Skills by first creating a separate branch in your forked repository:

```sh
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

Then, using the template under the `packages/_examples/plugin` folder, you can create a new Creator Agent Skills with the following script:

```sh
pnpm create:skills <skills-name>
```

To learn more on how to create your first skill, you can follow this tutorial [here](https://developer.moxie.xyz/creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/create-your-first-skill).

For further customization, you can refer to the Eliza docs [here](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/packages/plugins/#available-plugins) as Creator Agent Skills are simply Eliza Plugins with additional functionalities.

### General Guidelines For Skills Development

1. Name your Creator Agent Skill folder with the following format `plugin-<skills-name>`
2. Specify name & version in `package.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "@moxie-protocol/plugin-<skills-name>",
    "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

3. Place image for your Creator Agent Skill to be displayed Skills Marketplace under `packages/plugin-<skills-name>/images/logo.png` with size 400x400 px.

### Register Your Skills to Moxie

Once you completed development on your skills, you can register your skills to the Skills Marketplace by the following steps:

1. Add your Creator Agent Skills to the Skills Registry in [`registry/src/skills.json`](./registry/src/skills.json) with the following fields and corresponding types:

```ts
interface Skills {
    pluginId: string; // Any UUID, must be unique, to generate one use this https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
    name: string; // Creator Agent Skills name (based on package.json)
    version: string; // Creator Agent Skills Version (based on package.json)
    description: string; // Description of what the Skills can do
    author?: string | null; // Author/Creator of the Skills
    githubUrl: string; // GitHub URL to your Skills folder under `/packages`
    imageUrl?: string | null; // Image URL to logo.png (400x400 px) of your Skills, which should be located under the `/packages/<skills-folder>/images` folder
}
```

If you'd like to check if your skills is added properly, run the following command to start the Registry client app:

```bash
pnpm start:registry
```

You should see the skills you added in the Registry client app if the skills metadata is added properly.

2. If your Creator Agent Skill require environment variable for production purpose, then fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/8hzDyCVKKLs4MkTEA) to request submission. The Moxie team shall directly reach out to you either through **Email** ([support@airstack.xyz](mailto:support@airstack.xyz)) or **Farcaster** (group chat) for submission.

3. Lastly, commit all the changes you made on your branches and create a new [PR](https://github.com/moxie-protocol/moxie-agent-skills/pulls) to the repository's `main` branch.
