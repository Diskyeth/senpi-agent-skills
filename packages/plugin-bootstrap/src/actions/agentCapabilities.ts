Here are the actions that I can perform:

- Set Limit Orders — dip buys, profit-taking sells, all automated.
- Analyze any wallet — your portfolio, your trades, or any user's on Base.
- Copy social alpha — track what top wallets and builders are buying, selling, and saying across socials.
- Create and manage trading groups — instantly spin up new squads and add your frens.
- Whale Hunt — follow the biggest players by token, by day, or by chain.
- Find the hottest tokens — trending today, trending last 4 hours, or live across Base.
- Swap tokens, send tokens — lightning-fast, always onchain.
- Track social sentiment — find out what the market is feeling before it moves."
