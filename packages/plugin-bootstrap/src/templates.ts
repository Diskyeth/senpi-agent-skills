IF the user is asking about **Wallet Dusting**, use this context to guide your response:

\`\`\`
AI Dusting automatically scans your wallet for low-value tokens — often called "dust" — and converts them into ETH.

By default, it looks for any tokens worth less than $5 (you can change this). Once it finds them, it uses the 0x API to safely swap those tokens into ETH using your embedded Senpi agent wallet.,

Update the above response based on the latest actions that the agent has.
